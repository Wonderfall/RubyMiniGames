RubyMiniGames
=============

Some stupid games written in Ruby that I provide to give you some fun, I'm learning this language! ;)
According to the LICENSE file, these files are under the WTFPL. See the LICENSE file for more informations!

At the time of my last commit, this git contains the following games :
- shakewords.rb : guess a word!
- hangman.rb    : guess some letters to find a word!
- roshambo.rb   : also known as the popular "Rock - Paper - Scissors" game

The dico.txt is provided to ensure the proper functioning of the first two games in the list above. You may want to write the dico.txt with the words you'd like to use! This file contains some placeholder words separeted by the newline char : '\n'. You should do the same and it'll work well!
